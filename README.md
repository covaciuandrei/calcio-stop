# Calcio Stop - Football Jersey Inventory & Sales Management

This app started as a simple way to track jersey stock and orders, but grew into a full sales and inventory tool for small businesses selling football jerseys and related products.

## What it does

**Calcio Stop** is an inventory and sales management system designed for small businesses that sell football jerseys and other products. Whether you're running a local sports shop or managing an online jersey business, this app helps you keep track of everything from stock levels to custom player names.

The app handles the full lifecycle of your business:

- **Stock Management**: Track products, teams, and kit types
- **Custom Namesets**: Manage player names that get printed on jerseys
- **Sales Tracking**: Record and monitor your sales
- **Badge Management**: Keep track of team badges and logos

## Key Features

The dashboard provides a quick overview of your business at a glance, while each section (Products, Sales, Namesets, Teams, etc.) can be managed separately with dedicated pages for adding, editing, and archiving items.

What makes this app special is the **full customization** it offers. Users can reorder dashboard cards and appbar buttons from a settings popup, creating a personalized experience that matches their workflow. No more hunting through menus to find what you need most often.
